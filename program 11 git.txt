Experiment Explanation:

This experiment is about viewing the last few commits in a Git repository.

Every time you make changes and commit them in Git, a commit is created with a unique ID, author info, date, and a commit message.

Sometimes, you don’t need the full history; you just want to see the most recent commits.

This experiment teaches you how to add files, commit changes, and then view the last 5 commits. 


echo "I am in 11a" >> lab11a.txt
echo "I am in 11b" >> lab11b.txt
echo "I am in 11c" >> lab11c.txt
echo "I am in 11d" >> lab11d.txt
echo "I am in 11e" >> lab11e.txt

git add .
git commit -m "create index files"
git log -n 5
