Explanation:

This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from commit abc123.

Safe for branches shared with others because it doesn’t rewrite history.

After running this, Git will open an editor to enter a commit message for the revert. Save and close it.

git checkout master
echo "I am in 12a branch master" >> 12a.txt
git add 12a.txt
git commit -m "I am in 12a branch master"

echo "I am in 12b branch master" >> 12b.txt
git add 12b.txt
git commit -m "I am in 12b branch master"

echo "I am in 12a branch master changes 1" >> 12a.txt
git add 12a.txt
git commit -m "I am in 12a branch master changes 1"

echo "I am in 12b branch master changes 1" >> 12b.txt
git add 12b.txt
git commit -m "I am in 12b branch master changes 1"

git log --oneline
git revert ec9d05e
