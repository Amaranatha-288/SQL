Experiment: Collaboration and Remote Repositories
Aim

To clone a remote Git repository to the local machine using Git.

Software Required

Git

Git Bash

Web browser

GitHub account

Operating System: Windows / Linux

Theory

Git supports collaboration by allowing multiple users to work on the same project using remote repositories. A remote repository is usually hosted on platforms like GitHub.
The git clone command is used to create a local copy of an existing remote repository. It downloads all files, commits, and version history, enabling the user to work locally and collaborate efficiently.

Procedure

Open the GitHub website and select an existing repository.

Add a new file in the repository and commit the changes.

Copy the repository URL.

Open Git Bash on the local machine.

Execute the clone command using the repository URL.

The repository is copied to the local system along with its contents.

Command Used
git clone https://github.com/lingarajpower/3VC15CS065.git

Output
Cloning into '3VC15CS065'...
remote: Enumerating objects, done.
remote: Counting objects, done.
remote: Compressing objects, done.
Receiving objects: 100%, done.

Result

Thus, the remote GitHub repository was successfully cloned to the local machine using the git clone command.
