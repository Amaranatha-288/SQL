fetching the latest changes from a remote repository and rebasing your local branch—is a common Git workflow in collaborative projects. Here’s the explanation in detail:

1. Remote Repository

A remote repository is a version of your Git repository hosted on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). When multiple people work together, everyone pushes and pulls changes from this shared repository.

2. Fetching Changes

git fetch is used to download the latest commits from the remote repository but does not automatically merge them into your local branch. It updates your local copy of the remote branch.

Example:

git fetch origin


origin is the default name for the remote repository.

After fetching, your local origin/main (or origin/master) branch is updated, but your local main branch stays as it was.

3. Rebasing

git rebase is used to apply your local commits on top of the updated commits from the remote branch. This keeps the commit history clean and linear.

Example:

git rebase origin/main


What happens here:

Git temporarily removes your local commits.

Updates your branch to match the remote branch.

Reapplies your commits on top of the updated remote branch.

4. Why Use Rebase Instead of Merge?

Merge: Combines remote changes with your local commits and may create a "merge commit," which can make history messy.

Rebase: Keeps a straight, clean history by replaying your changes on top of the latest remote commits.






echo "Collaboration experiment file" > index.txt
git add index.txt
git commit -m "add index file"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Amaranatha-288/3VC24CS010.git

git pull --rebase origin main
