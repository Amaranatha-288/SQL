Theory

Git tags are used to mark specific points in a repository’s history, usually to represent software versions such as v1.0 or v1.1. Tags help developers easily identify important commits like releases or stable versions.

There are two types of tags in Git:

Lightweight tags – These are simple pointers to a commit and do not store extra information.

Annotated tags – These store additional details such as tag message, author name, email, and date.

In this experiment, a lightweight tag (v1.0) and an annotated tag (v1.1) are created and listed using Git commands. The tag details can be viewed using the git show command.


git checkout main
git tag v1.0
git tag
git tag -a v1.1 -m "tag for release ver 1.1"
git tag
git show v1.0
