This experiment explains how Git stores every change as a commit with a unique commit ID (hash).
Using the git show command, we can display full information about a specific commit, including:

Commit hash

Author name

Date and time

Commit message

Changes made to files

This helps in tracking history and verifying modifications in a repository.

git checkout master
echo "I am in 8a" >> lab8a.txt
git add .
git commit -m " I am in 8a branch master "
git log
git show f7b46493e18b1dd58703830637ae9d3e615adbde
