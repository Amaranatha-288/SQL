Theory: Cherry-Pick in Git

Git Cherry-Pick is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

Unlike git merge, which combines all changes from one branch, cherry-pick allows you to select only the commits you need.

It is useful when:

You want to apply a bug fix from a feature branch to master.

You need a specific feature from another branch without merging all other changes.




# Initialize repository (run only once)
git init

# Create first commit on master
echo "I am in 9a" >> lab9a.txt
git add lab9a.txt
git commit -m "I am in 9a branch master"

# Create and switch to new branch 'cheery'
git checkout -b cheery

# Add commit in cheery branch
echo "I am in 9b" >> lab9b.txt
git add lab9b.txt
git commit -m "I am in 9b branch cheery"

# Switch back to master
git checkout master

# Cherry-pick latest commit from cheery
git cherry-pick $(git log cheery -1 --pretty=format:"%h")

# Verify cherry-pick
git log --oneline
