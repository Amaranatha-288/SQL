Theory: Cherry-Pick in Git

Git Cherry-Pick is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

Unlike git merge, which combines all changes from one branch, cherry-pick allows you to select only the commits you need.

It is useful when:

You want to apply a bug fix from a feature branch to master.

You need a specific feature from another branch without merging all other changes.




# 1. Make sure you are on master and create a master commit
git checkout master
echo "I am in 9a" >> lab9a.txt
git add lab9a.txt
git commit -m "I am in 9a branch master"

# 2. Create and switch to new branch 'cheery', add a commit
git checkout -b cheery
echo "I am in 9b" >> lab9b.txt
git add lab9b.txt
git commit -m "I am in 9b branch cheery"

# 3. Switch back to master and cherry-pick the commit from cheery
git checkout master
git cherry-pick $(git log cheery --oneline -1 --pretty=format:"%h")

# 4. Verify the cherry-pick
git log --oneline
